# Hardware-Info
Hardware Info gives you all the information about your CPU, GPU, Memory etc. This app will monitor your hardware like CPU and GPU temperature, clock frequencies and load and plot them.
I am currently working on the CPU section, temperature, load and frequency realtime update will be added later on.
New features will be added to this app regulary :).

In order for Hardware info to work, run these commands in cmd (windows):

python -m pip install â€“upgrade pip

pip install py-cpuinfo

pip install psutil

pip install matplotlib
